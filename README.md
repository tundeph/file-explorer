# File Explorer

This project  is a file explorer that basically works like the Finder app on Mac 

IMPORTANT: The data for the demo is dynamically generated and needs json-server to be activated to work properly
Apart from `npm start` open another terminal and type `json-server db.json` to get the Fake API working.
